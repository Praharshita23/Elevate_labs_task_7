Task 7 – Basic Sales Summary using SQLite & Python
Objective

The objective of this task was to use SQL inside Python to extract basic sales insights such as total quantity sold and total revenue per product. The results were displayed using print statements and a simple bar chart visualization.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

This task was completed using:

Python

SQLite (via the built-in sqlite3 module)

Pandas

Matplotlib

Google Colab

SQLite was used as a lightweight database solution that requires no external installation.

Database Creation

A small SQLite database file named sales_data.db was created within the notebook. The database contains a single table called sales.

The sales table includes the following fields:

product (TEXT)

quantity (INTEGER)

price (REAL)

Sample sales records were manually inserted into the table for analysis.

SQL Query Executed

The following SQL query was used to calculate total quantity and revenue per product:

SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;

This query groups records by product, calculates the total quantity sold, and computes revenue by multiplying quantity and price for each record.

Revenue was calculated using the formula:

revenue = quantity × price

Data Processing Steps

The workflow followed these steps:

Connected Python to the SQLite database using sqlite3.connect().

Executed the SQL query inside Python.

Loaded the query results into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_sql_query().

Displayed the results using print().

Created a bar chart using Matplotlib to visualize revenue by product.

Saved the chart as sales_chart.png.

Visualization

A basic bar chart was created where:

The X-axis represents products

The Y-axis represents revenue

This visualization helps compare revenue generated by each product.

Repository Contents

Outcome

By completing this task, I practiced:

Writing and executing SQL queries

Using the GROUP BY clause for aggregation

Connecting Python to a database

Importing SQL results into Pandas

Performing simple sales summaries

Creating a basic data visualization

Conclusion

This task demonstrates how SQL and Python can be integrated to perform simple yet effective data analysis. It shows how structured data stored in a database can be queried, summarized, and visualized within a single workflow using Python.
